# 🛒 OpenCart REST API Testing – Cart Module (Postman)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **manual REST API testing** of the **OpenCart Cart Module** using **Postman**.  
The objective is to validate the complete **end-to-end cart workflow** of an eCommerce application by testing core cart-related APIs and ensuring their **reliability, accuracy, and proper authorization**.

This project demonstrates practical exposure to:
- REST API testing concepts
- REST architecture
- Token-based authentication
- Backend functionality validation **without UI involvement**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **XAMPP** – Local server environment  
- **Apache** – Web server  
- **MySQL** – Database management system  
- **Postman** – REST API testing tool  
- **OpenCart** – eCommerce platform  

---

## 🧩 Modules Covered
- Cart Module (REST APIs)
- API Session / Token Generation
- Add Product to Cart
- View Cart Contents
- Edit Product Quantity
- Remove Product from Cart

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- API authentication is handled using an **API Token**
- The token is generated through the **OpenCart API Login endpoint**
- All cart-related API requests require a valid **api_token** for authorized access

---

## ✅ Testing Focus Areas
- REST API functionality testing
- Token-based authentication & authorization
- HTTP status code verification
- Request and response data validation
- Cart workflow accuracy and consistency
- Data integrity during cart operations

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with REST API testing using Postman
- Understanding of API authentication and session handling
- Validation of real-world eCommerce cart workflows
- Practical exposure to backend testing without UI dependency

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project provides **real-world experience in manual API testing** of an eCommerce application.  
It validates the **complete cart lifecycle** in OpenCart and demonstrates readiness for **Software Testing / QA Internship roles**, with a strong foundation in **REST API testing concepts**.
